# Simple-shell

I made this project for my University assignment, it is a simple little shell program that let's the user do multiple things such as making new users, classifying users and similar functionalities. It also has some inbuilt and external commands that have their resemblance to a Linux shell.

It is a linux based application, so make sure to run it on a linux machine, since some of the functionalities won't work on other OSs.

Running the code: Fork the project, download the code and maske sure to use a .csv file to store the user info in the following format <user,pass,boolean>


Dont hesitate making changes to the code as per your need, any kind of contribution towards the repo is highly appriciated.


Cheers, to a world where everyone has maximum exposure to information, free of cost.
